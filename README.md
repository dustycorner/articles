This repository contains all magazine articles that I have had published and 
retain copyright to.

Articles will only appear here once I have received a copy of the magazine 
containing the published article, so as not to preempt publication.

It is generally intended that the files in these articles will not change once 
they have been published, although minor fixes, correcting grammar or spelling 
for instance, may be made.

Unless a particlar article's directory contains a LICENSE file, the article is 
available under the licence given in the LICENSE file in this top-level 
directory.
