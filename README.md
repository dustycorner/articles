# Introduction

This repository contains all magazine articles that I have had published and 
retain copyright to.

Articles will only appear here once I have received a copy of the magazine 
containing the published article, so as not to preempt publication.

If an article refers to source code that is not available elsewhere, and is not 
included as part of the article text itself, that will also be included in this 
repository. This is so it can be available to readers of the article before the 
article text itself has been put in this repository.

It is generally intended that the files in these articles will not change once 
they have been published, although minor fixes, correcting grammar or spelling 
for instance, may be made.

Unless a particlar directory contains a LICENSE or LICENCE.txt file, the article 
is available under the licence given in the LICENSE.txt file in this top-level 
directory.

# Articles

The following lists the articles included in this repository and the magazine 
edition they were first published in, along with any notes. A directory that is 
not referenced here most likely holds code referenced by a to-be-published 
article.

https://accu.org/journals/cvu/cvu31-3. Voted joint 2nd favourite article in
